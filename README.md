# StyleLint plugin for IntelliJ

Stylelint plugin for all products based on the IntelliJ Platform (IntelliJ
IDEA, RubyMine, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm, AppCode, etc.)

## How to use

You can use the program in two ways:

1. Install stylelint globally (`yarn global add stylelint`)
2. Use project stylelint (`yarn add --dev stylelint`).

If you don't install stylelint globally and the project doesn't have it
installed, the plugin will silently quit.
